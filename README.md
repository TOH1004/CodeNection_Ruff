# Ruff üêæ ‚Äì Campus Safety Companion

Ruff is a campus safety application designed to protect students through friend accompaniment, AI support, blockchain-secured safety logs, and a smart SOS system.
Built by Team Pelajar-Pelajar.

## What Problem We Solve
‚Ä¢	Many students and staff feel unsafe when walking alone, especially at night.
‚Ä¢	Sometimes they want a companion, sometimes they just need someone checking on them.
‚Ä¢	And in a real emergency, they need to quickly send their exact location to trusted people.
‚Ä¢	On top of that, stress and fear can get overwhelming ‚Äî so we provide an AI companion to keep users calm, cared for, or entertained.


## What Our App Does 

### Start a journey <br>
User must first start a journey and enter a ‚Äúroom.‚Äù <br>
The room acts as a session where friends or guardians can monitor the journey in real-time. <br>
Once the journey has started, other features like AI Companion and SOS button become available. <br>

### Post Status for Company <br>
Users can create a status whenever they want a companion to walk home with them.  <br>
They can also control who is able to view the post, and the system will only display their coarse location for privacy.  <br>
Other users can then browse the in "status" to see these posts in real time. <br>

### AI Companion (3 Modes) <br>
If a user is still alone, they can choose to be accompanied by our AI Buddy. <br>
Our AI Buddy comes with useful skills such as calming scripts, campus safety tips, and helpful reminders which offers **three** supportive modes.  <br>
In Silent Mode üéµ, the AI stays mostly quiet, giving short affirmations and playing soothing background music.  <br>
In Chatty Mode üí¨, it engages with cheerful conversation, fun facts, and friendly banter to keep the user company.  <br>
In Caring Mode ü§ó, the AI provides gentle reassurance, emotional support, and calming tips to help users feel safe and at ease. <br>

### SOS Button <br>
With a single tap, users can activate the emergency SOS button whenever they feel unsafe.  <br>
Once triggered, the app instantly records their exact GPS location and a precise timestamp. <br> 
At the same time, the backend calculates the safest and fastest route to a nearby secure place, such as a guardhouse or operating stores.  <br>
Guardians and campus security are immediately notified with the live location and route details, allowing them to respond quickly and effectively. <br>

### Safety Check Timer <br>
A safety check is included that asks users to tap their phone within one minute to confirm they are okay.  <br>
This quick action reassures both the system and their guardians that the user is safe and alert.  <br>
If no response is detected, the SOS button is automatically triggered. <br>

### SOS History Timeline <br>
Users can access a history section that displays all of their past SOS activations in a clear timeline format and the place with details address for safety audits. <br>

### Offline Safety Guidance
If the user has no internet connection, the app will display the nearest guardhouse address and their destination address using pre-downloaded data.

## Technical Parts

Provides quick lookup for route to pre-stored safe locations during emergencies.<br>

### Blockchain Layer
Implemented with Ethereum or Polygon.<br>
Automatically creates a unique digital identity for each user.<br>
Stores immutable SOS logs with GPS location and timestamp.<br>

### AI Companion
Powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). <br>

### APIs for Safety Guidance
Google Places API ‚Üí Finds safe places (guardhouses, clinics, police posts) and checks if they are open.<br>
Google Directions API ‚Üí Calculates walking routes, distance, ETA, and safest path to open safe places.<br>

### Notifications System
Uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for real-time push notifications.<br>
Integrates with SMS or WhatsApp API to ensure guardians/security are alerted even without the app.<br>

### Offline Event Syncing
Stores SOS events locally when there is no internet.<br>
Automatically syncs them to backend and blockchain once connectivity is restored.<br>

### Safety Timer Mechanism
